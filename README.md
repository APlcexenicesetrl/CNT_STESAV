# Introduction

### **Welcome to use 『CNT』**

CNT STESAV is called "CNT Special Text Encryption System Algorithm Value" and "1236787232" in Chinese.

This is a system algorithm for data protection against the CNT series, and this data protection algorithm is open,

but the reverse destruction of non-open source algorithms is prohibited.

### **Warning**

CNT STESAV was developed by TaimWay to provide encryption algorithms for CNT series.

To some extent, some of these algorithms will be used in public.

This algorithm is licensed by MIT, anyone can use, forward, (twice) change the STESAV algorithm.

### **License**
